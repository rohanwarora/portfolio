## Education:

BS Data Science & Economics | George Washington University Honors (May 2025)

## Work Experience:

#### Data Engineering Intern @ CarGurus (June 2024 - August 2024)
As an intern with the Data Engineering Team, I collaborated with Data Analysts, Software Engineers, and Data Scientists to build and maintain numerous data models using dbt, Snowflake, and Looker. I optimized SQL queries for datasets with +100 million rows, achieving high performance and cost reduction. Additionally, I designed and implemented scalable big data pipelines using Airflow, improving the efficiency of data flow and processing.


#### Data Science Year-Round Intern @ Federal Reserve Board (May 2023 - May 2024)
During my internship at the Federal Reserve Board with the BOPA team, I had the opportunity to hone my technical skills while contributing to impactful financial decision-making processes. I developed various machine learning models using Python and R, such as a predictive model for the division's budget. I also created and maintained comprehensive Tableau and Power BI dashboards, providing managers/officers with clear insights that led to cost-saving opportunities. This experience was invaluable in solidifying my interest in data and demonstrating the real-world impact of analytical solutions.


#### Honors Research Assistant @ George Washington University (October 2022 - May 2023)
As a research assistant, I have experience constructing and analyzing large datasets to study complex topics. In this role, I created a panel dataset covering over 3,000 counties and 22 years to investigate the impact of unionization on voting access measures in the United States. I used quasi-experimental methods and regression analysis (using R and STATA) to study this relationship and conducted thorough research on the topic to validate and support my data analysis. This role interested me as it allowed me to develop my data skills, which I will use in my career.


#### AmeriCorps Member @ Mission: St. Louis, Beyond School (August 2020 - June 2021)
I served for an AmeriCorps Program called Beyond School Mission St. Louis. I helped a group of 13 sixth graders prepare for High School and beyond with social/emotional learning, enrichment activities, community service, and individualized academics. I was also the volunteer specialist of my school, helping recruit and train 40 volunteers to work with our students. I learned a lot while working for Beyond School, specifically skills of volunteer management, tutoring, and database management. The entire experience was really precious as it broadened my views and taught me important life skills, which I know I will use in the future.



## Projects:

#### [Personalized Book Recommendations with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Python)]
This project is a work in progress for my data science thesis. When this is completed, I will add the project here.


#### [From Tweets to Foreign Trade: How Trumpâ€™s Social Media Shaped International Markets (Python)](projects/Python/Arora_thesis_final.pdf)
This project investigates the impact of Donald Trump's Twitter activity on foreign exchange market volatility during his presidency, employing high-frequency intraday data and utilizing the Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.5 model for tweet classification. The study analyzes over 56,000 tweets, categorizing them into trade policy, international relations, economic policy, and security topics while examining their effects on major currency pairs, including the Turkish Lira, Canadian Dollar, and Mexican Peso. Through Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis and sentiment interaction terms, the research reveals significant correlations between Trump's tweets and currency volatility, demonstrating how social media communications from world leaders can create distinct information shocks in global financial markets. This analysis marks a contribution to understanding the intersection of social media, political communication, and financial markets, while providing practical insights into how individual-driven sentiment can influence global market dynamics.

#### [Shaping a Happier World: Insights & Regression Analysis on the 2017 World Happiness Report (R)](projects/R/worldhappiness report/FinalProject.html)
This project analyzed the 2017 World Happiness Report in R, examining the factors influencing happiness scores and variations across regions. The study utilized correlation matrices, box plots, regression analysis, and feature importance tests to identify that life expectancy, economic factors, and freedom were the most impactful variables on happiness scores, with regional variations observed in their correlations.

#### [Multi-Linear Regression Exploring the Link between Food Insecurity and Asthma: Evidence from the 2018 National Health Interview Survey (STATA)](projects/STATA/Econometrics Final Project.pdf)
This project, conducted as part of my Econometrics class using Stata, delves into the intricate relationship between food insecurity and asthma in the United States, utilizing data from the 2018 National Health Interview Survey. It marked my first foray into machine learning and provided invaluable skills in conducting logistic and linear regressions, data analysis, and interpreting results. Regression analysis in STATA reveals statistically significant findings, including a positive association between food insecurity and asthma risk, as well as the impactful roles of income, family size, and regional factors. I also examine the model's validity and acknowledge potential sources of bias, such as measurement errors and population differences, in my analysis.

Throughout my journey in this class, I've gained a profound understanding of the intricate dynamics that underlie empirical analysis. This final project, exploring the correlation between food insecurity and asthma, has reinforced the importance of sound statistical methodologies, data validation, and cautious interpretation of results. Moreover, econometrics has taught me to recognize the multifaceted nature of real-world data and the need to address potential biases and limitations in any analysis. It's not just about crunching numbers; it's about gaining insights into complex socioeconomic phenomena and contributing to evidence-based decisions. Econometrics has equipped me with valuable skills in hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and model evaluation, which I can apply across various domains to unravel meaningful insights from data and contribute to informed decision-making processes.
